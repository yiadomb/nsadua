## 🚀 Your Very First Task

**Choose your starting point:**

### Option A: I need help setting up WordPress
→ Tell me: "I need help with WordPress setup"
→ I'll guide you through hosting, installation, and plugin setup

### Option B: I have WordPress ready, let's start building
→ Tell me: "I'm ready to start Phase 1"
→ We'll begin with the foundation (custom plugin structure)

### Option C: I want to understand the architecture first
→ Tell me: "Can you explain the technical architecture?"
→ I'll break down how everything connects

## 💬 How to Ask for Help

### Good Questions (I can help with these):
- ✅ "How do I create a custom WooCommerce product field?"
- ✅ "Can you show me the code for the logo API endpoint?"
- ✅ "My form isn't submitting, what's wrong?" (share your code)
- ✅ "How do I filter products by school category?"
- ✅ "What's the best way to store customization data in WooCommerce?"

### Questions I'll Guide You On:
- ✅ "I'm stuck on Phase 3, Step 2" → I'll break it down further
- ✅ "I don't understand how WooCommerce hooks work" → I'll explain
- ✅ "Can you review my code?" → I'll review and suggest improvements

## 📝 What to Share When Asking for Help

### When You're Stuck:
1. **What you're trying to do** (e.g., "Add a school dropdown to product page")
2. **What you've tried** (share your code)
3. **What's happening** (error message, unexpected behavior, nothing happens)
4. **What you expected** (what should happen)

### Example:
> "I'm trying to add a school dropdown to the product page. I added this code to my plugin file [paste code], but the dropdown isn't showing up. I expected it to appear below the product image."

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### You'll Learn:
- WordPress plugin development
- WooCommerce customization
- PHP basics (as needed)
- JavaScript for form interactions
- REST API creation
- Database management

### I'll Provide:
- Code templates (copy, paste, customize)
- Explanations of how things work
- Best practices
- Debugging help
- Architecture guidance

## ⏱️ Realistic Timeline

Based on the simplified approach:

- **Phase 1-2** (Foundation + Products): 1 week
- **Phase 3** (Customization Form): 1 week
- **Phase 4** (Entry Paths): 1 week
- **Phase 5** (Logo Logic): 1 week
- **Phase 6** (Checkout): 3-4 days
- **Phase 7** (Polish): 1 week

**Total: ~5-6 weeks** (working part-time, with my guidance)

*Faster if you have WordPress experience, slower if you're learning as you go (which is fine!)*

## 🎯 Your Next Action

**Right now, tell me ONE of these:**

1. **"I need help with WordPress setup"** - We'll start from the beginning
2. **"I'm ready for Phase 1"** - We'll create the plugin structure
3. **"I have a question about [specific thing]"** - I'll answer it
4. **"Can you explain [concept]?"** - I'll break it down
